# Magic Mirror

The Magic Mirror is a RaspberryPi-powered home assistant that functions as both a mirror and smart assistant. 

It originally began as a semester-long project for USC's electronics club, [MAKERS](https://www.facebook.com/uscmakers/). The v1.0 release of the project featured basic date/time capabilities, as well as weather API integration. Since then, we've continued to keep up production and work on new features. Building the mirror has been both an exciting project and a fun learning experience for web development. 

# Hardware

The hardware of the mirror is relatively simple. We used a [22-inch Sceptre Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Sceptre-E225W-1920-Screen-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B00S8W8Z5E). We with this one because both the HDMI and power ports face to the sides, which allows for a thinner mirror and better cable management. After removing the plastic casing for the monitor, we used pine wood to build a wooden frame.
